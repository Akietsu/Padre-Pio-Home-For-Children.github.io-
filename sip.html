Background of the study
</p>
<p class = "content">
Composting is well known as the process of recycling organic matter into fertilizer. 
It is significant for the community and most especially the environment as it enriches the soil,
 reduces waste,  and reduces the use of chemical fertilizers that could be harmful to the environment 
 because they can lead to soil degradation, loss of soil carbon, and more. It is said that organic
 fertilizer is better for soil, as we know that soil plays an important part in plant growth, meanwhile
 commercialized fertilizer is better for plants. However, it is not yet addressed whether organic fertilizer, 
 specifically banana peels as compost works for the plant Lactuca sativa. It is important to address this 
 because plants play a very vital role in regulating biodiversity; they release oxygen and absorb carbon dioxide.
 This study is important, especially for the institution of Padre Pio Home for Children, because one of their 
 livelihood sources is farming, and they own crops. This would be able to help their agricultural knowledge advance,
 which is beneficial for them as their resources come from the environment. Composting is immensely beneficial for
 everyone as it promotes safe and healthy growth for plants and addresses waste management for
 it affects several communities including this institution.<br><br>

Statement of the problem
</p>
<p class = "content">
The Institution lacks sustainability because they are in need of a sustainable option of producing food because the 
pandemic has recently plummeted their donations. The institution could make use of commercial fertilizer, however, 
it is costly and disadvantageous for the environment. To be able to foster food security sustainably, the institutions 
should inquire about composting. Scientific data must be identified on whether organic compost is helpful for the growth of plants.<br><br>
